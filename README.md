# AAA3A_utils - Shared tools

This is a Python package made for [AAA3A-cogs](https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/AAA3A-cogs).

The "AAA3A_utils" sub-folder is automatically copied to every cog directory in the main repo, so that all changes can be sent at once, everywhere.

I abandoned the pip package idea because updating was initially difficult. Then, if a user updated one of my cogs or installed another one, the tools were updated. But, another cog, not updated, might not work anymore because it would use a potentially old method of tools.

For more info (docs, contributing, contact), please check the AAA3A-cogs repository.

## Install

Type the following command in your console:

```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/AAA3A_utils.git
```
